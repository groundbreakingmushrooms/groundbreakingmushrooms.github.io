                            <p>Peeps DIY is hosting a 6 week workshop series to open up the world of fungi and demystify the growing process to would-be growers of edible mushrooms. This series aims to empower the grower to close the loop and create a perpetual growing system at home, equipping you with the knowledge and skills to have home-grown mushrooms all year round, with simple, step-by-step techniques that are easy to follow and master.</p>
                                               
                                  	<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/IMG_4597 1.png" alt="" /></span>In the first half of the workshop series you will learn how to make a scalable home mushroom grow block using everyday materials with low-tech, hands-on techniques that are easy to perfect. You will understand the basics of mycelium and mushroom biology and learn how to prepare and pasteurise substrates. You will practice inoculating your own prepared substrate mushroom mix that you can take home and watch the magic happen. We will also explore how mycelium binds and shapes substrates, allowing for modular growing systems that take advantage of small spaces.</p>
													
                            
                           <p>In the second half of the workshop series we will investigate the art of regenerative mushroom growing and cloning. We dive into clone culture basics and cardboard cultivation - taking a small piece of mushroom tissue and cultivating it on cardboard to produce your own mycelium foundation. We will explore different levels of sterility and how to work in a semi-sterile environment. You will learn hands-on methods of making your own mushroom spawn starter using different materials such as hessian strips, sawdust and cardboard pellets.  </p>
                            
                            
                             <p>Finally, to wrap it all up you will learn how to combine all these procedures into a sustainable home-based production system. You will be able to use your own home-grown mushrooms to regenerate more mushrooms by cloning and cultivating the mycelium into starter spawn. You will then prepare and inoculate your own substrate, allow it to gestate and produce more mushrooms. You can then clone these mushrooms again to make more starter for inoculation - hence ‘closing the loop’, eliminating the need to keep buying starter spawn and establishing your own permanent mushroom production system!</p>
