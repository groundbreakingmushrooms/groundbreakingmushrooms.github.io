                                        <h4></h4> <p1>We have developed a method using coffee sacks as a substrate for grey oyster mushrooms. There are many reasons why coffee sack fabric is perfect for this and we think we are on to something with this. <br/> <br/> Jute / hessian fibres are coarse and loosely woven, which means they allow air exchange. The sack acts as both the container and the nutrient source, eliminiating the need for single use plastic bags. Coffee sacks are made from plant-based fibres, so they can break down over time and even be digested by the mycelium. While breathable, jute also holds moisture well - important for maintaining humidity. Easy to handle and adaptable - can roll into logs, stack as bricks or layer like lasagne. The nutrients are hard to access for many micro-organisms, fungi are able to digest coffee sacks easier than bacteria.  <br/> <br/> We're selling the logs for $25 each, you'll get at least 1kg of mushrooms out of each log, which consists of two coffee sacks.  <br/> <br/>Or, if you want to grow your own, drop us a line and we'll sort you out with all you need to make up your very own log! <br/> <br/> Email us to reserve your log!</p1>
